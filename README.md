- **Log Processor**: Centralizes and analyzes tool outputs

## 📥 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose


### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repo_url>

```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Start Docker Containers**
```bash
./start-kali.sh
```

3. **Start all servers**
```bash
./main.sh
```


### AI Engine Settings
```yaml
ai_engine:
  model: "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf"
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All tools run in isolated Docker containers
- Rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
- Authentication required for sensitive operations
- Results encrypted at rest
